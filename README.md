# The_continuity_equation

This project is one of the practical works at the Physics Faculty of Moscow State University of the 3rd year on the subject of OMM (basics of mathematical modeling).
Here we consider the continuity equation. In the 'Characteristics' section, we build the characteristics and look at the presence of an intersection. The 'Evolution' section shows the graph profile over time.
The solvation is made based on the running account scheme (схема бегущего счёта).
In this program, you can set grid parameter - number of grid steps. To do this, after setting the parameter, click the "Set and download CSV" button. A csv file will be downloaded to your computer, which you need to upload to the Internet and insert a link to it in the 'Put a link for CSV file' field. Then press 'Commit'.
